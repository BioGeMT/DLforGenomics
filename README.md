# Genomics Hackathon 2024

## Update after Hackathon

We are making available testing data with labels: https://github.com/BioGeMT/DLforGenomics/raw/main/data/Hejret_2023/miRNA_test_set_10_label.tsv

Feel free to use this data to evaluate your models. The evaluation metric is the area under the precision-recall curve (look at see sklearn.metrics.auc and sklearn.metrics.precision_recall_curve).

If you have a new solution, especially with area under the precision-recall curve above 0.661, let us know.

## Description

Training data: https://github.com/BioGeMT/DLforGenomics/raw/main/data/Hejret_2023/miRNA_train_set.tsv

Testing data: https://github.com/BioGeMT/DLforGenomics/raw/main/data/Hejret_2023/miRNA_test_set_10.tsv

Submission:
- Add a new column to the file miRNA_test_set_10.tsv
- Name of column = name of your solution
- Values = your predictions (ideally in the range from 0 to 1)
- Sent the file to the address: biogemt@um.edu.mt 
- Subject: Genomics Hackathon
- Deadline: 12.6.2024 23:59

Evaluation metrics:
- The area under the precision-recall curve (see sklearn.metrics.auc and sklearn.metrics.precision_recall_curve) 

Result announcements:
- The best solution will be awarded a prize on Friday 14th at 11:00
- Several best solutions will be invited to give a short presentation on Friday 14th at 11:00
